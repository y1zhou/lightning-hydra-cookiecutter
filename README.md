A clean template to kickstart your deep learning project ðŸš€âš¡ðŸ”¥<br>

_Suggestions are always welcome!_

</div>

<br>

## ðŸš€Â Â Quickstart

If you don't already have [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html) installed, use either of the following tools to add it to your `PATH`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user cookiecutter
conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
pipx install cookiecutter
brew install cookiecutter # macOS only
```

Now you can generate a new project from this template with a one-liner. Note that you will be asked for a few things like the project name, open source license, etc. to bootstrap the project.

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/y1zhou/lightning-hydra-cookiecutter
```

## Project Structure

The directory structure of new project looks like this:

```
